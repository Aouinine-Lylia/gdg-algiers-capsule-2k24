I am Lylia Aouinine, UX Co-manager for 2024-2025.

Here are some cherished memories I’ve gathered from my time with GDG Algiers. I am deeply grateful to everyone I’ve met through GDG, as this experience has significantly contributed to my growth in communication, collaboration, and boosted my confidence.

Thank you for being part of this incredible journey!

I had my first workshop at DevFest 2021 in UI/UX, and it was through GDG that I discovered this incredible field I’m now passionate about. It opened a new door for me, and I will forever be thankful for that.

I also participated in my first hackathon with my dear friends ❤️ Aicha, Amina, Dyna, and Hind, which was an unforgettable experience. The long hours, teamwork, and shared laughs made it one of the best moments in my GDG journey.

Hosting a workshop was a milestone for me. I remember how stressed I was about teaching people, but it all worked out in the end. That’s also when I met Sihem 3>, a moment that marked a special connection for me.

A special thanks to Hadjer, who always supported me—she’s truly an angel and has been there every step of the way.

Lastly, I enjoyed coding at GCPC, even though the challenges were humbling, it was a great learning experience, and it taught me perseverance.

Excited to see how the community will grow in the future—we just hit 18k followers on Instagram at the moment I write this, and I wish the community continuous growth and success.

Looking forward to making even more memories with the best community!
GDG for once, GDG forever.
